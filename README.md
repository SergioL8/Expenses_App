# Expenses_App
 
This app, coded in dart with implementation in flutter, is a simple app that tracks the expenses of the user. The objective of this app is to learn how to store and manage different types of user input. Moreover I wanted to learn how to use that input to dynamically modify the UI of the app, for which I implemented a dynamic chart that varies depending on the input of the user.

The main characteristic of this app is the dynamic chart, I'm aware that there are a lot of improvements I could apply to the app, such as dynamic input  validators, include an option to create more categories, and the UI could be much more beautiful. But all these extra characteristics are implemented in other projects in my profile.

I also want to remark that for this project I have included the option of setting the dark theme, as well as landscape and vertical orientation.
I have tried to add a lot of comments to make the code as clear as possible but if you have any questions I'll be more than happy to answer them.

Have a great day!
